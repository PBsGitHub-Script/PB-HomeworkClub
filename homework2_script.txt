#Homework2_Script

#1. Created a new repository in my GitHub; named it PB-HomeworkClub, added description, clicked on only
"Add a README file." Other options "Add .gitignore" and "Choose a license" are not required for now.

#2. Main branch was selected by default

#3. On terminal command line for GitHub below: 

pwd
/Users/pankajbhatta
cd Desktop
git clone https://github.com/PBsGitHub-Script/PB-HomeworkClub.git #url for the repository was copied from the GitHub. 
								  #This command clones our repository directory in the path we want it. In my case, it is in 								           the desktop
touch Homework1.doc #new doc file for homework1 was created  
open Homework1.doc #opened the doc and texts for homework was added from the old file
git status #checked the status to see that there's a file in the directory that Git isn't keeping track of
git add . #this command is to tell git to keep track of all the added files to the directory. 
#### this might not work it might need to be git add * to add all the files.

	  #you can also use the the command "git add Homework.doc" to add just one file
git status #now you wil see that git started keeping track  of your files, but t hasnâ€™t recorded these changes as a commit yet
git commit -m "homework1 is here" #now the commit has been added to the changes
git push origin main #this command will push all our codes and texts to our file in the directory to the repository

touch homework2_script.txt
open homework2_script.txt #writing the Homework2_Script here
git status
git add homework2_script.txt
git status
git commit -m "homework2 is finally here. Phew."
git push origin main


### overall nice job!
